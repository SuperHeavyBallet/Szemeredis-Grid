Currently, Reset resets the grid,  but not the number collection
Also, I want to experiment with higher count progressions (Potentially allowing any number, but that may be expensive)
Currently, further progressions can be sought after finding one, but there is no ouput of those prior findings, so probably a text display recording the numbers and the count between them s hould be added
